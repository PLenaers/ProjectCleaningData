# ProjectCleaningData
The run_analysis.R script shows how to collect, work with, and clean a dataset.

## Reading libraries
First some libraries are loaded.

## Load the data
Then the data is loaded in and converted to tables that dplyr can work with.

## Ex.1 Merging
The databases are then merged into one big database.

## Ex.2 Calculate mean and standard deviation
Consequently the mean and standard deviation of the experiments are calculated.

## Ex. 3 Use descriptive names
The numeric values describing the type of activity are changed into actual descriptions as defined in activity_labels.txt.

## Ex. 4 Change variable names
The variable names are changed according to the labels in features.txt. Originally these hold some non-allowed characters so the function make.names has to be called to clean this up.

## Ex. 5 Create a tidy dataset
Lastly, the data is grouped by activity and subject, and the mean for each if the variables in each of these groups is calculated
